<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Welcome to COSC 292 (Advanced Programming 2)! In this class, you will study a procedural programming language called C. For a description of the class and details about what will be covered, see “COSC292.25.docx”. For instructor information and the schedule for covering topics, see “COSC292 Supplemental Course Information Winter 2026.docx”.</p>
<p>The prerequisite for this class is COSC 183 (Intermediate Programming 2), so the assumption is that you have programming experience with languages like Java before you start this class.</p>
<p>Programming environment</p>
<p>We will use Visual Studio 2022 as our programming environment in this class. After starting Visual Studio 2022, choose Create a new project:</p>
<p>From the ensuing dialog box, choose the language C++ (Visual Studio doesn’t have a specific template for C files, so we will use the C++ template, since C++ is a superset of C – we will discuss this later) and choose an Empty Project and then select Next:</p>
<p>Enter a project name (such as Intro) and choose a location for the project, and then choose Create.</p>
<p>Note that in SaskPolytech labs, you MUST choose the location C:\VisualStudioProjects. This choice is required because C produces executable (.exe) files that would otherwise be blocked by SaskPolytech security settings. At home or elsewhere, you can choose any location that you like.</p>
<p>Note that C:\VisualStudioProjects is a local folder that is not backed up anywhere, so you should copy or move your projects to a backup location such as your OneDrive folder when you are done working on them and move them back if you need to change the project later.</p>
<p>You should see the Visual Studio environment with a Solution Explorer pane (on the right or the left – choose View | Solution Explorer if you don’t see this pane) and a Standard toolbar (right-click on the toolbar to get a list of available toolbars if you don’t see the Standard toolbar).</p>
<p>To create a C source file, right-click on Source Files and choose Add &gt; New Item…. Visual Studio will suggest a C++ File (.cpp) – you can select that, but you need to change the Name of the file to something with a .c extension (such as program.c) to make it a C file. Choose Add.</p>
<p>It may show up in Compact View:</p>
<p>Or, if you select Show All Templates, it will show further options:</p>
<p>Let’s try writing a simple C program to verify that our setup works. In program.c (or whatever you named it), add the following code (you don’t have to enter the comments if you don’t want to):</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; // add the standard input/output library
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; // add the standard library</code></pre>
<p>// Create a function called main which is where the program will start</p>
<p>// The return type and arguments are standard, but could be replaced with "void"</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
	printf("Hello, world!\n"); // printf is a function to print to the console</code></pre>
<p>return EXIT_SUCCESS; // return a value of 0 (successful run)</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">}</code></pre>
<p>Try to run the program by pressing F5 (to start with debugging) or Ctrl+F5 (to start without debugging) or using the buttons on the standard toolbar ( or ) or using the menu options (Debug | Start Debugging or Debug | Start Without Debugging). You should see a new window pop up with the output that looks like this:</p>
<p>If you can’t get your program to run, review these steps and then contact your instructor for help.</p>
<p>Procedural languages</p>
<p>The language that we will be studying in this class is C. C is a procedural programming language. A procedural language is one in which the tasks of a program are broken into procedures (also called subroutines or functions). To write a program, you decide which procedures and data structures you want to use and choose the best algorithm for each procedure. Support is based on functions communicating by passing arguments and returning values. Examples of procedural languages include C, Fortran, COBOL, BASIC, and Pascal.</p>
<p>This can be compared to object-oriented programming, where you decide what classes you need, provide a full set of operations for the class, and make commonality explicit using inheritance. You also separate what can be accessed from inside and outside the class using modifiers like private and public. Examples of object-oriented languages include Java and C#. Note that when you started writing programs in Java using only a single class and static methods, you were essentially doing procedural programming.</p>

<p>C is a popular language (among the top four in the TIOBE index - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIOBE_index - and along with C++, in the top 5 of the PYPL Popularity of Programming Language Index - https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html). It is known for its low-level capabilities which allow it to create efficient programs that take advantage of the design of the machine that it is working on, making it well suited for things like operating systems and device drivers. Thus, part of what you will learn in this class is how the machine deals directly with data, seeing things that other languages may have hidden.</p>
<p>The name C came from its predecessors, BCPL and then B, with C being the next letter in line. C was developed in the early 1970s and was used to write the UNIX operating system. C did not have an original standard, although the book by Brian Kernighan and C’s creator Dennis Ritchie was commonly used, called K&amp;R C from the initials of the authors. C was later standardized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with versions coming out in 1989/90 (C89 or C90), 1999 (C99), and later.</p>

<p>C++ is an object-oriented superset of C, which means that it includes all the features of C but also includes extra object-oriented features. It was developed in the early 1980s. We will not cover C++ in this class, but you will have a basic background in it based on covering C.</p>
