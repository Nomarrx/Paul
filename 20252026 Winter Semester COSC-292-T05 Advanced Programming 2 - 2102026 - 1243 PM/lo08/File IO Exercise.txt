// In class exercise
/*
Write a function that will write out 3 records worth of information entered by the user.
Each record consists of:
	SIN# (integer)
	Name (char array of MAX_NAME_SIZE)
This information is entered in using scanf (remember to get the \n off the buffer after scanf)
and fgets from stdin (so a space can be included in the name).

After entering a record, write the data out to a binary file.
Repeat until 3 records have been written out.
Do some error checking after each write.
Close the file.

Write code in a separate function to read in from the file and display the information
contained within. Note that you will need to either write the number of records as the first
integer in the file, or check for end of file after each record using the feof function.

If you get that done, modify your read code to get user input of an integer and determine
whether that record exists in the file and what its associated name is. (You may want to use
fseek to skip over names that are not associated with that integer.)
